# CodeMirror 6 language package for PostgREST

This package implements syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Stencila's SQL-like language for [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) when used within CodeMirror 6. The current implementation is simplistic (e.g. autocompletion makes suggestions that are inappropriate given the context). Improvements will be made if/when there is demonstrated demand from users for using this language.
